         <h1>ABOUT LITS</h1>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">
         	League of Information Technology Students (LITS) was formed in March 22, 2004. It was established to help and address the needs of IT students in UE Caloocan. During the formation, the first name of the organization was “INTEL” or “Information Technology League” but due to intellectual property and patent laws, the use of the name should be requested first to the INTEL Company. “It should be unique”, the senior adviser thought of, then assigned the officers came up with the idea of changing INTEL into League of Information Technology Students. Thus, the birth of LITS as a student organization.
<br><br>
         	The program Information Technology was once under the College of Business Administration. The founder and first adviser of the student organization was Mr. Christopher I. Abat. He perceived that the population of Information Technology would increase every semester. For this, need for a student organization that would assist I.T. students arise. Mr. Abat then decided to gather students who could stand as a role model and officers of the organization. He subsequently chose the top IT students to be the first officers of the organization. Among the selected students were Jherold John Valdoz for President, John Ryan Celis for Vice President - Internal, Roel Quiambao for Vice President - External, Hannah Lyn Taleon for Secretary, Derick Fontanilla for Auditor, Evangeline Joice Vergara for Treasurer, Alvin Ray Estiva for PRO1, Daphne Mae Manuel for PRO2.
